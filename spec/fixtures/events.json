Using the global `$&` variable in the\r\ngsub resulted in calling capitalize on a nil object for reasons I still\r\ndo not fully understand. Removing the UNSAFE_STRING_METHODS override for\r\nthe gsub method in SafeBuffer \"fixed\" the bug but is obviously\r\nunacceptable.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is very easy to see in rails console:\r\n\r\n    ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new(\"my test\").titleize\r\n    > NoMethodError: undefined method `capitalize' for nil:NilClass\r\n\r\nUsing the non global version of gsub with a |match| arg passed to the\r\nblock fixes the problem. Again I do not quite understand why. I noticed\r\nthat other parts of Inflector were already using the standard block arg\r\nversion of gsub so I don't think it should be a problem to convert this\r\nmethod to using it as well."
